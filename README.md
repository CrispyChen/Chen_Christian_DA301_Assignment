# Project Title: Analysing Customer Trends to Improve the Sales Performance of Turtle Games

# Project Description:
A moderately in-depth foray into predictive data-analytics techniques and visualisations, via Python and R, making use of pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and tidyverse. Done primarily as an assignment activity for the London School of Economics and Political Science's (LSE's) Data Analysis Career Accelerator. The key results of this exploration of Turtle Games' data indicate that there are promising insights to be gained from predictive methods, with key results being: 
- MLR is very effective at predicting loyalty points and global sales,
- K-means clustering identified k=5 key customer groups, and thus, market sectors,
- Sentiment analysis of review and summary textual data revealed interesting insights into customers' opinions of Turtle Games' products.
